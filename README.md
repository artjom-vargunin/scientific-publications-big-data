## Scientific-publications Big Data on DataBricks

This "Big Data Management" course group project aims to implement small Big Data project consising on the following parts
- Extract, Transform, Load phases on scientific publication data
- SQL-like Quering
- Creating knowledge graph: graph quering and analytics
- Solving example classification task
- Solving clustering task

Notebooks are made for running in DataBricks platform developed for Big Data manipulations by creators of Apache Spark. To start with DataBricks
- go to community.cloud.databricks.com
- open "compute" tab
- create cluster (for classification and clustering use ML cluster)
- upload notebooks and attach cluster
- run
